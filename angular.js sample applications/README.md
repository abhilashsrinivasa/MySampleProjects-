AngularJS is a front-end web development framework made to build Single Page Applications. Provides client side Model View Controller architecture.
The main objective of Angular is to convert web pages into web applications. 
Angular helps to organize JavaScript, creates responsive websites quickly, can be used with jQuery and it is easy to test.

</br>Angular Concepts.

 * Directives: Angular extends HTML using **[directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)**, adding behaviours to DOM elements and its children. Directives are the most important component of AngularJS because they express the behaviour to our application whereas HTML only expresses structure. 
 * Modules: Angular apps don't have main methods, so each part of your app is contained by a module. (this keeps messy JS clean). **[Modules](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module)** can use other modules also.
 * Expressions: Angular uses expressions to bind data into HTML, can be written {{ example }} or inside of directives. 
 * Controllers: We define the behaviour of our app in the controllers.
