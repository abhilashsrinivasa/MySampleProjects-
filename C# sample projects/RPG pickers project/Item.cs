        protected string Name - Name of item
        protected decimal BuyFor - How much can the player buy this item from the NPC for?
        protected decimal SellFor - How much is this item actually worth? Tallied at the end of the game to determine score
        protected string Description - description of the item
        protected bool WillingToSell - Is the NPC willing to part with this item? The player can only buy an item if so.
        protected bool FirstInquire - Is this the first time you look at an item? If it's past the 1st time you'll get an abridged response upon revisiting an item.
        protected string FirstLook - What is printed out to the console the first time looking closer at this item?
        protected string LookAgain - What is printed out to the console after the first time looking closer at this item?
        protected string Thanks - What does the NPC say if you buy the item?
        public string ResellExplanation - why did this item sell for as much as it did?
        protected bool FriendCalled - Have you called a friend yet or not for this item? Can only call a friend once per item.

Defined Methods:

        public void DisplayItem - Writes out all of the associated information about an item.
        public void BuyItem(Player player, Location location) - shows the user the cost of the item and their cash and their remaining cash should they buy the item. If they answer Yes they would, then the item is added to the player's inventory and deleted from the location's items list. They can back down and say no if they'd like to
